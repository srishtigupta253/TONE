# TONE 
TONE: A 3-Tiered ONtology for Emotion analysis, is an emotion-based ontology that effectively establishes an emotional hierarchy based on Dr. Gerrod Parrot's group of emotions. This classification allows for greater granularity, capturing subtle variations and acknowledging the interrelatedness of emotions using various dependencies. By leveraging Parrott’s model, TONE offers a flexible, culturally adaptable framework that more accurately reflects the dynamic nature of emotional experiences.
